# Tutorial: Unsupervised Learning with ACL Analtyics

## Background

Finding patterns within a dataset is challenging, as it generally lacks labelled data, let alone any sort of discerable patterns. Unsupervised learning algoritms are powerful, exploratory tools that may help shed some light on patterns that may not be obvious on the surface.

With ACL v14 and the introduction of the CLUSTER command, this enables audit practitioners to leverage a machine learning tool to further examine datasets to find potential patterns as part of their analysis.

This tutorial will briefly touch on what K-means is doing, as well as showing you how to execute the equivalent outside of ACL, but retain those results in R.

**Why is this important?** 
By understanding the fundamentals of using ACL's ```RCOMMAND```, you will be able to assign clusters to your data using any unsupervised method of labelling of your choosing, empowering you to use the best algorithm for your needs (since there is no such thing as a free lunch).

## Pre-requisites

* Access to the ACL 303 Academy, which gives you access to the ACL 303 1-6 Data.zip data file: https://academy.acl.com/learner/courseinfo/id:325 

## Situation: Analyzing call logs and the length of these calls



## Instructions
### Step 1: ACL Analytics - prepare the data

### Step 2: R - Scale

### Step 3: R - Create and save clusters

** What about the centers? **

### Step 4: R - Understanding cluster assignments

### Step 5: ACL Analytics - Creating tests based on these cluster assignments
